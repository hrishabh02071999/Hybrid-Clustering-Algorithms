# Hybrid-Clustering-Algorithms
Project has been completed after going through various research papers. Data used was from benchmark dataset from Mopsi datasets. It comprised 6014 coordinates of locations in Joensuu city in Finland. The idea of the project is to cluster disease infected areas as input and use our Hybrid algorithms for efficient data mining in health care industry.

The hybrid algorithms have been run and its performance has been analysed using Silhoette scores and Time complexity.

Upon comparing with existing algorithms, it can be proved to be useful and beneficial for real use.

The algorithms were also run on AWS Sagemaker and helped to understood how AWS server works and its features.
